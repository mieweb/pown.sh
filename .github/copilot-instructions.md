## Code Quality Principles
- Use log instead of echo for messages

### üéØ DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself)
- **Never duplicate code**: If you find yourself copying code, extract it into a reusable function
- **Single source of truth**: Each piece of knowledge should have one authoritative representation
- **Refactor mercilessly**: When you see duplication, eliminate it immediately
- **Shared utilities**: Common patterns should be abstracted into utility functions

### üíã KISS (Keep It Simple, Stupid)
- **Simple solutions**: Prefer the simplest solution that works
- **Avoid over-engineering**: Don't add complexity for hypothetical future needs
- **Clear naming**: Functions and variables should be self-documenting
- **Small functions**: Break down complex functions into smaller, focused ones
- **Readable code**: Code should be obvious to understand at first glance

### üßπ Folder Philosophy
- **Clear purpose**: Every folder should have a main thing that anchors its contents.
- **No junk drawers**: Don‚Äôt leave loose files without context or explanation.
- **Explain relationships**: If it‚Äôs not elegantly obvious how files fit together, add a README or note.
- **Immediate clarity**: Opening a folder should make its organizing principle clear at a glance.

### üîÑ Refactoring Guidelines
- **Continuous improvement**: Refactor as you work, not as a separate task
- **Safe refactoring**: Always run tests before and after refactoring
- **Incremental changes**: Make small, safe changes rather than large rewrites
- **Preserve behavior**: Refactoring should not change external behavior
- **Code reviews**: All refactoring should be reviewed for correctness

### ‚ö∞Ô∏è Dead Code Management
- **Immediate removal**: Delete unused code immediately when identified

## Documentation Preferences

### Diagrams and Visual Documentation
- **Always use Mermaid diagrams** instead of ASCII art for workflow diagrams, architecture diagrams, and flowcharts
- **Use memorable names** instead of single letters in diagrams (e.g., `Engine`, `Auth`, `Server` instead of `A`, `B`, `C`)
- Use appropriate Mermaid diagram types:
  - `graph TB` or `graph LR` for workflow architectures 
  - `flowchart TD` for process flows
  - `sequenceDiagram` for API interactions
  - `gitgraph` for branch/release strategies
- Include styling with `classDef` for better visual hierarchy
- Add descriptive comments and emojis sparingly for clarity

### Documentation Standards
- Keep documentation DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) - reference other docs instead of duplicating
- Use clear cross-references between related documentation files
- Update the main architecture document when workflow structure changes

## Working with GitHub Actions Workflows

### Development Philosophy
- **Script-first approach**: All workflows should call scripts that can be run locally
- **Local development parity**: Developers should be able to run the exact same commands locally as CI runs
- **Simple workflows**: GitHub Actions should be thin wrappers around scripts, not contain complex logic
- **Easy debugging**: When CI fails, developers can reproduce the issue locally by running the same script

## Quick Reference

### Code Quality Checklist
- [ ] **DRY**: No code duplication - extracted reusable functions?
- [ ] **KISS**: Simplest solution that works?
- [ ] **Naming**: Self-documenting function/variable names?
- [ ] **Size**: Functions small and focused?
- [ ] **Dead Code**: Removed or archived appropriately?

### Before Committing
1. Run tests: `npm test`
2. Check for unused code: Review imports and functions
3. Verify DRY: Look for duplicated logic
4. Simplify: Can any function be made simpler?
5. Archive/Delete: Handle any dead code appropriately
